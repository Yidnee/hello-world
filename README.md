Learned Progression 
Hello my dear aquaintances and lovers, I am Yidnekachew Moynihan. I am on the beggining of another journey into the worlf od programming. I have attempted my hand at understanding code and being able to write it but I have missed a crucial step each time. THis time around I am skipping on the practical side of things and being more thourough in my preparation of learning. I am excited by this new found drive to apprecitae the process of this decesion and the wonderful community that seems to be programming. Watch this space :)
